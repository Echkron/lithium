ortholinear low profile split keyboard
unfinished, untested and incomplete. use at your own risk.


there are (will be) 2 sets of pcbs available, standard and segmented

standard uses a single pcb for each side of the split

segmented uses a motherboard for the mcu and 2 daughterboards for the keys per side of the split, in order to fit the purchased pcbs into 10x10 cm for seeed studio's extremely cheap fusionpcb service. the daughterboards are connected to the motherboard via ribbion connectors. segmented boards are lettered A and C, with the mcu/motherboard being A (daughterboard B is on the same pcb/gerber), and daugheterboard C.
